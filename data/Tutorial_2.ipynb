    "Hey everyone, welcome to Tutorial 2 for CLPS1520: Computation Vision.  I’m Denise, and I’m one of your TAs for this class; in this tutorial, I’ll be going over some Matlab tips and tricks to help you work through your assignment.  Specifically, I’ll be going over creating and using filters on photos in Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "In image processing, filtering is a technique traditionally used for modifying or enhancing an image. For example, you can filter an image to emphasize certain features or remove other features. We can create a filter in a number of ways, from handwritten functions to built-in functions in Matlab.  Let’s first try creating a filter from scratch! For instance, a box filter is a relatively simple filter.  It is just a square matrix with the same element in each entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "So let’s start by defining how big this filter will be.  Let’s just try making it 10 by 10 (fill in ``height`` and ``width`` below).  The ``ones()`` function will create a n by m matrix where every element is a 1 -- this will make it easier to calculate the actual value the elements should be.  Then we can pointwise square each element in the matrix, then use ``sum(sum())`` to calculate the sum across all rows and columns of your matrix, and finally squareroot the entire expression.  Finally, we divide our elements in the original matrix by the calculated value to normalize.\n"

Of course, your main goal should be completing the assignment and not spending a lot of time thinking about naming conventions.\n",

The only difference between correlation and convolution is that convolution assumes that the image has been transposed, meaning that the filter was flipped horizontally as well as vertically.  The differences are mostly due to historical reasons--convolution and filtering by correlation were developed in different fields.\n",

I would recommend looking up the documentation for ``imfilter()`` for a full list of the arguments available.\n",
